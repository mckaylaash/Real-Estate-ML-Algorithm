# Real-Estate-ML-Algorithm
ML Algorithm that uses housing data and visual features to recommend homes based on customer specifications.

Plans to implement a ML learning algorithm to train based on data such as number of rooms, square footage, and sell price, as well as visual features of the hours, to give an estimate of the selling price of a home. The user should be prompted on number of rooms and square footage, and potentially location if location specific data sets are collected.
